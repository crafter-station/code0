# Ultra Deep Research - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build **Ultra Deep Research**, an AI-powered research application that revolutionizes how comprehensive research is conducted by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple leading AI models working in parallel.

## 🚀 Core Concept

The application orchestrates **4 parallel AI models** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Perplexity) to conduct simultaneous research on any given topic, then synthesizes their findings through a **synthesizer AI** to produce an ultra-comprehensive, cross-validated research report.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Aesthetic Excellence**: Inspired by industry leaders like Vercel, Linear, and Supabase
- **Minimalist Approach**: Clean, focused UI that puts content first
- **Design Engineering**: Pixel-perfect implementation using shadcn/ui components
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Current Phase)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with shadcn/ui components
- **Typography**: Custom font configuration with serif fonts for headlines
- **Icons**: Custom AI provider icons (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Perplexity)
- **Branding**: Crafter Station attribution with custom icon

### Backend (Future Phase)
- **Multi-Provider Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Perplexity APIs
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent API calls to all 4 providers
- **Synthesis Engine**: AI-powered merger and analyzer of multiple research outputs
- **Report Generation**: Structured, referenced, and exportable ultra-reports

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Input**: User submits a research question or topic
2. **Parallel Research**: System simultaneously queries 4 AI models:
   - OpenAI for comprehensive analysis
   - Anthropic for detailed reasoning
   - Google Gemini for multimodal insights
   - Perplexity for real-time data and citations
3. **Synthesis**: A dedicated synthesizer AI merges all 4 responses
4. **Output**: Ultra-comprehensive report with cross-validated insights

## 💡 Key Differentiators

- **4x Perspective Power**: Multiple AI models provide diverse viewpoints
- **Ultra Speed**: Parallel processing delivers comprehensive results in single-model time
- **Ultra Accuracy**: Cross-validation reduces hallucinations and bias
- **Ultra Comprehensive**: Combines strengths of different AI architectures

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Landing Page
- Hero section with "Ultra Deep Research Reports" branding
- "Built by Crafter Station" attribution badge
- Clean workflow visualization (Ask → Research → Report)
- Provider showcase in footer with custom icons

### Visual Elements
- Strategic use of "Ultra" branding without overwhelming
- Gradient backgrounds using design tokens
- Card-based layout for workflow steps
